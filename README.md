# RocketFirmware
Note: This code is an eclipseArduino workspace. It should compile on the Arduino IDE with a few modifications though.

<h2>About</h2>
This Arduino firmware logs vertical speed, altitude, attitude and acceleration data from rocket flights into an SD card with high efficiency.
This solution assumes the following hardware:
<ul>
<li>Arduino board (My solution uses an Arduino Mega, although certain other boards should be perfectly fine, with a few modifications to the code)</li>
<li>Pololu AltIMU series Inertial Measurement Unit (For this code, up to V4. V5 requires different libraries and might thus require some modifications to the code)</li>
</ul>

Note to the \*hackers\*:
This code was written in a very structured way, so it is very easy to add your own methods, sensors etc...<br>
Feel free to contact me if you would like to make your own fancy feature available to the open source public!
